# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Restarting a Worker After Code Changes

If you make changes to your Workflow or Activity code, you need to restart the worker for the changes to take effect. In your notebook, either find a cell that does this or create one.

a. On the top left of the screen click the `+ Code` button:

b. The codeblock to kill and restart the worker should contain something similar to:

```python
import asyncio

# Cancel the existing worker
x = worker.cancel()

# Restart the worker
worker = asyncio.create_task(run_worker())
```

### 2. Checking Running Workers

To see what workers are currently running, create a codeblock (see 1a):

```python
# Check if worker task is running
if worker and not worker.done():
    print("Worker is running")
else:
    print("Worker is not running")

# Get more details about the worker task
print(f"Worker task: {worker}")
print(f"Worker done: {worker.done()}")
print(f"Worker cancelled: {worker.cancelled()}")
```

### 3. Handling Workflow Task Errors

If there's an issue like a typo in your workflow code, it will cause a Workflow Task error. When this happens, the notebook block will run forever because it's blocking on the stalled workflow.

**Solution:**
- Click the **'Interrupt'** button in Jupyter notebook:

- Fix the typo or error in your code
- Restart the Worker using the code block in section 1 above
- Re-run your Workflow

### 4. Not seeing a `.env` file?

Create a `.env` file at the root of your directory (if running notebooks for study) or at the root of your `exercises` directory (if running exercises) that contains the following:

```
LLM_API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY
LLM_MODEL = "openai/gpt-4o"
```

### 5. Rate Limitting Issues

If you are getting an error about your API key rate limiting, add around $5 to your OpenAI account. To do so, go on the [billing page](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) and then add more credits.

### 6. Unable to Access Codespace

If you are unable to create a Codespace, make sure that you go through the SSO process with Temporalio. To do so, click the Settings tab on the repo which will take you through an authentication process to sign in.
