# Foundations of Durable AI with Temporal

This repository contains a hands-on workshop demonstrating how to build AI agents with Temporal Workflows. 
The workshop teaches the progression from fixed flow AI applications to production-ready, durable systems that handle failures gracefully and support human-in-the-loop interactions.

## How to Use this Repository

1. To try this workshop, use in Codespace so that you don't need to download any software on their machines. To do so, refer to [this document](./codespaces.md).
2. This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks under [the notebooks directory](./notebooks). The notebooks are used as an educational tool for to get practice with being hands-on with Temporal. 
3. The slides that accompany the Jupyter notebooks are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N4YSml7yA3Gfq3svDFJpC6afQVn_m2txl4jwQ-lJqBQ/edit?usp=drive_link).
4. When there is a a little icon of a person at a keyboard on the bottom right of the slides, this lets you know that it's time to get hands-on and move to the notebooks.
    - If you start running out of time, in the `solution` directories, there are `solution` files (e.g. `notebooks/Solutions_03_Human_in_the_Loop/03_Human_in_the_Loop_Solution.ipynb`) with filled out versions of the notebooks
5. There will also be time for you to practice working independently with the material in the [exercises directory](./exercises/). The Jupyter notebooks will reference when it's time to do work on an exercise directory.
6. For the self-serve version of this workshop (no need for slides), refer to the `self-serve-version` branch on this repository.

## Workshop Overview

This workshop demonstrates four key concepts:

1. **Fixed flow AI application** - A simple research agent that calls an LLM and generates a PDF report
2. **Durable Execution** - The same agent built with Temporal workflows for fault tolerance and automatic retries
3. **Human-in-the-Loop** - Adding Temporal Signals to enable human decision-making within AI workflows
4. **AI Agents** - An introduction into the Agentic Loop
