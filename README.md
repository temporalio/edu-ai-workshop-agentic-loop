# Foundations of Durable AI with Temporal

This repository contains a hands-on workshop demonstrating how to build AI agents with Temporal Workflows. 
The workshop teaches the progression from simple AI agents to production-ready, durable systems that handle failures gracefully and support human-in-the-loop interactions.

## Workshop Overview

This workshop demonstrates three key concepts:

1. **Traditional AI Agent** - A simple research agent that calls an LLM and generates a PDF report
2. **Durable Execution** - The same agent built with Temporal workflows for fault tolerance and automatic retries
3. **Human-in-the-Loop** - Adding Temporal Signals to enable human decision-making within AI workflows
4. **AI Agents** - An introduction into the Agentic Loop
